Hi everyone! About 2 weeks ago, I was walking home when I saw a wallet on the ground. It was so big that it could fit a phone inside. I knew I had to find the owner, so I picked it up and tried to find the persons phone number inside, and as i suspected the phone was there.

I wanted to return it because of everything inside. It seemed like the only right option. So then i started looking for the address to his place of living, when I found it I looked it up, and as it turned out it was pretty close, so I went there to return it. I came to his house and rung the bell. He answered and started thanking me for finding his wallet. He was relieved when he got his wallet back.

I felt good about returning John's wallet. I know how frustrating it is to lose something important, so I wanted to make sure that he got his wallet back. I'm glad that I was able to help someone in need.

Stay tuned and leave a comment about similar situations that happened to you!
